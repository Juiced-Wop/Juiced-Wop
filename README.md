Hello, I'm Vinni Horstkotte, and I'm using the Github Repository as a place to 
showcase some of the code I've written to potential employers. Currently, it is
the home to my only project at the moment, Celerity; I plan on adding my other 
projects here when I start them.

Celerity can be viewed here on itch.io:
